                "As I recall California and maybe Massachusetts tried to force busing with some convoluted theory that if you made them have busing in the North that that would make people quit trying to integrate the South.",

                "I had gone to visit some friends in Butler, Alabama, and we had gone over to Meredian to eat lunch because a) Meredian had better restaurants than they did in Butler, and b) Meredian, this was the main reason, at that time was \"wet,\" and Choctaw County, Alabama was \"dry,\" so we went over to Meredian.",
                "The lunch drug on into the afternoon.",
                "We had a friend that was a reporter for the Meredian Star newspaper.",
                "He came down to join us and mentioned that the Attorney General from Mississippi, A. F. Simmer, Al Simmer, Judge Simmer, was in town making a speech.",
                "He said, \"We ought to get him to come by and meet you.\"",

                "He was a great guy, wonderful, wonderful, outgoing, decent, fun fellow.",
                "He said he was looking forward to me going to those cases with him, that they all had a good time going to the hearings, the cases I'm talking about in California, Massachusetts, or wherever they had them.",
                "I said, \"I'm not going to be going.",

                "He was an older man about my dad's age or maybe even older.",

                "He was widely recognized when I came in as the best, most able lawyer in the Attorney General's office, career lawyer.",
                "Later the people I brought in were also very, very able, but of the ones there he was by far, I think, the most able.",
                "I got a list of all the cases that were pending in Alabama, obstructionist type cases on these voting rights matters and others.",

                "Like I say, he was my dad's age, but he was well thought of.",
                "My dad thought a lot of him and was very fond of him.",
                "He was, incidentally, a direct descendant of James Madison, President Madison.",

                "There were going to be a lot of people that would support what we wanted to do.",
                "I don't mean to give the impression, let me correct this early on, even in college or now that all I thought about was civil rights.",
                "Gosh, I was a wild person about partying and having fun.",
                "I did other cases, too, that didn't have anything to do with civil rights, and I like to think did them well, and enjoyed life.",
                "I don't want people to think that I was obsessed with only that.",
                "But, I reckon the next thing I started out trying to break the color line, so to speak, and hire some black assistant attorneys general.",
                "It took a little while to find the first one, and it was Myron Thompson.",
                "I found him through the help of my father who was friends with his grandfather, a gentleman from Dothan, a gentleman by the name of John Henry Glanton whose son for years was on the Dothan city council.",
                "Of course back at that time he wasn't on the city council.",
                "By the time I hired Myron Thompson I think the only blacks that worked for the state were custodial, janitorial people, other than those that taught in the public schools.",
                "None of them worked up there for the state.",
                "When we hired Myron he'd finished way up at the top of his class at Yale Law School.",
                "He turned down jobs in New York and elsewhere paying him substantially more than what we could pay him to come back to Alabama which was, of course, his home.",
                "His mom and his step father were in Tuskegee and his grandparents in Dothan.",
                "Myron was a terrific lawyer, brilliant guy, and did a great job for the state.",
                "He's now the chief United States district judge for the middle district of Alabama.",
                "He's been on the bench.",
                "Carter appointed him.",
                "After several years with me he left and went back to Dothan and had a very successful law practice there before he was appointed to the bench.",
                "I got three or four hate letters about that, and that was all.",
                "That was the end.",
                "We set out to try to bring others.",
                "We didn't want just tokenism.",
                "Shortly behind Myron we brought in we brought in Dan Thompson who'd finished at Harvard Law School, then later I think became general council for Potomac Bell or maybe AT&T or something.",
                "Dan moved back.",
                "Some of his people were from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and I think he preferred the East so he moved back, but he was a great addition also.",
                "Soon Charlie Price came in.",
                "Charlie grew up a lot rougher than Myron or Dan.",
                "He grew up a lot poorer, very different from Myron and Dan whose families had advantages.",
                "For instance, Dan's father was a doctor.",
                "He was, I believe, head of the VA Hospital in Tuskegee, and Myron's family was educated.",
                "Charlie's family were working, but Charlie worked his way through and fought his way up.",
                "He'd been special forces in Vietnam.",
                "He was the toughest prosecutor I ever had on my staff, maybe other than me.",
                "He left me and went to work in Montgomery, became an assistant DA and city judge for Montgomery, and for the last twenty years probably, has been circuit judge.",
                "He's now presiding circuit judge in Montgomery County.",
                "I think Milton Davis was next.",
                "Milton came in and he, like the rest of them, was outstanding.",
                "He's got a very active practice in Tuskegee now.",
                "He was president of Alpha Kappa Alpha which is an international fraternity that's quite prestigious.",
                "To serve as international president of that is quite an honor itself.",
                "Oh, I lost track.",
                "Milton Belcher came on at some point.",
                "I think that was a few years later.",
                "He's still in the Attorney General's office.",
                "Vanzetta Penn at that time Vanzetta Penn Durant, now Vanzetta Penn McPierson came on.",
                "She's now United States magistrate in Montgomery, but we ended up having many, many outstanding black attorneys come to work for us.",
                "I think if we hadn't aggressively gone out and tried to recruit them, I think that a lot of them might not have come back to Alabama because there were no opportunities for them here, and we, we the people here, would have lost these brilliant minds.",
                "When they ask me what I think my best accomplishment in public service is I say quickly, and I mean this with all my heart, it's the people, black and white, male and female, that I brought back to go to work for the state because many of them would not have come back to Alabama.",
                "The overwhelming majority of them stayed in Alabama after they came back.",
                "I think that would have been a brain drain, and I think that that's easily my greatest accomplishment, being able to bring those people back to Alabama.",
                "I suppose somewhere along that time, I think it was May of '71, four or five months after I took office Sheriff Amerson, who was the first elected black sheriff in modern times in the South, had been indicted by the federal government.",
                "I thought it would send the wrong signal for him to be removed, and I felt like he had some justification for what had happened so I came in and offered to defend him.",
                "The way we did that was to say we were going to start a policy to defend every law enforcement officer that was charged with a crime if we investigated and found independently that he, he or she, there weren't many shes back then in law enforcement, but if he had some justification for what he was doing.",
                "We wouldn't defend anybody that just was dishonest or absolutely brutal with no circumstances that might be a defense for whatever brutality might have been alleged.",
                "We kept that policy up and defended many officers after that.",
                "Most of them I tried myself, and I think we won all of them.",
                "I don't even remember now losing a case.",
                "We tried Sheriff Amerson's case with an all white jury.",
                "Fred Grey, who is now president of the Alabama Bar and was Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King's lawyer in the boycotts and was the first black legislator elected, this was before he got elected to the legislature, of course.",
                "Fred represented Sheriff Amerson with me, and he and I tried the case.",
                "I think it was an all white jury, but we won the case.",
                "Oh gosh, that's about as much background as I can remember right now off the top of my head."

                "So Stoner was our first suspect, and we proceeded after him, looking at him, and that trailed on for quite a while, and finally concluded that although Stoner had done a lot of other bombings he didn't do this one.",
                "He didn't do the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, but he had done a lot of others.",
                "He was mostly inept in his bombing.",

                "I'm glad.",

                "So we had to just put it on the back burner, and we were continuing to really go after the one where the deaths, the little girls were killed, Sixteenth Street, and it just became obvious, like I said, he did a lot of others but not that one.",

                "So we would do a little bit of work on this and then have to put it down and go do something else, and come back so it was not a case that you could just work on a regular schedule.",
                "Sometime around that same time, or well not the same time, after we decided Stoner wasn't the one, we got a tip that the Klan in Montgomery had come up to Birmingham and done the Sixteenth Street bombing, so we went back and started working that.",

                "I think that came after.",
                "I don't think we got that indictment until after we indicted for the bombing though, but we came back to it and got an indictment eventually.",

                "No question we solved the case, but we couldn't bring him to trial which was a tragedy.",
                "The judge threw it out because we couldn't prove at that time cause of death.",
                "Later the people on their death bed, some of them, confessed to it.",
                "Eventually, though, the roads led to Chambliss and his group, Blanton and Cherry, and their group as we started working on that.",
                "By then we were several years into my term.",
                "As we started pursuing the Chambliss group it became rather obvious to us that they had been the suspects from the beginning of the FBI, and they had been looked at by the other investigating agencies, the state agencies that we had.",
                "Their names popped up from the beginning, but with the FBI they were the only suspects from the minutes almost after the bombing.",
                "It got to a point where I knew that we were going to have to get access to the FBI records if we were going to have any success, and so I started trying to get the FBI's cooperation and was met with one story and tale after another.",
                "It is obvious now that it was just a delay, and shuffling, and they wouldn't say no, but they would give one put off after another over, and over, and over, and over again.",
                "I was patient a lot longer than I should have been.",
                "The reason I was patient is I felt like that there was probably good reason for them to be suspicious of a deep South law enforcement agency because of the bad record they'd had in the past.",
                "I think the FBI is due a lot of credit for what they did to break the back of the Klan, and they're certainly deserving of a lot of credit, and J. Edgar Hoover is deserving of a lot.",
                "What they did to come in in the '50s and the '60s, particularly in the '60s, what they did I had nothing but admiration for it.",
                "Without them and their efforts there's no telling what additional atrocities the Klan would have done.",
                "So I said, well, I'm standing there reluctant.",
                "I want to show them how they can trust me, and I spent a lot of time trying to show them how I had worked with the FBI as a young prosecutor, how I knew these agents that I felt like would vouch for me, how we certainly didn't have any connection with the Klan.",
                "That didn't get anywhere and months became years.",
                "We kept trying to do our investigation as best we could, and that led us more and more on our own merits to Chambliss and his group, Blanton and Cherry, and the others, and we worked quite a bit.",
                "But all that did was make it more obvious that we were going to have to have access to the FBI's work to piece it together with ours.",
                "Even when we'd get information on our own we needed to make sure that what our people were telling us was consistent with things they had said earlier.",
                "We wanted to make sure.",
                "Some of the people that were giving us information weren't exactly the most reliable people in the world, you know, so we needed to double check in addition to whatever the FBI had that we didn't know about.",
                "But, I didn't get anywhere with being patient.",
                "Didn't get anywhere with reason, and begging, and everything else.",
                "Hoover died, and I thought maybe after he was gone that I might have better luck.",
                "Nothing changed.",
                "Then Nixon left office, and Pat Grey left office.",
                "I can't remember when Clarence Kelley came in, but anyway nothing changed with the FBI.",
